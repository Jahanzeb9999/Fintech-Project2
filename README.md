# Fintech-Project2
In our previous project, we worked on providing accurate investment decisions when it comes to Canadian Banks. We have worked on 4 major Canadian Banks, Toronto Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal Bank of Canada. We have have compared their performance over the last 6 years with respect to S&P500. 

In this project, our team has worked on implementing Machine Learning Techniques to predict the performance of those Canadian Banks, taking their historical data into accounts and predict how they might perform in the future.
We have deployed the Machine Learning methods used behind the scene and deployed them into a streamlit app, making it simple and easy for anyone who wants to extract feature, view  the performance or even train their own data!
Our model provides business solutions to a vast customer base such as retail traders or anyone who wants to know more about a particular stock before making investment decisions. 

Although our model is based on 4 Canadian Banks, because our main focus was to provide easier investment decisions
